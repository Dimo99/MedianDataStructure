# MedianDataStructure

Data structure that supports efficient memory and performence operations
1. Adding a number to the structure
2. Calculating the median

The first operation is supported in O(logN) time. (Amortized time, because of the resizing of the inner collection)
The second operation is done in O(1) time.

Criteria:
1. Well-structured code. Easy to read and understand
2. There are automatic tests.
3. Hosted on github.com (or bitbucket.com, or gitlab.com).
4. The operations to add a number and calculate the median have a minimum time complexity.

# Note that tests are written using the Microsoft Unit Testing Framework for C++
